Basically I need everything google music or Spotify musicplayer code doesâ€¦.

Music control (rewind, next play, pause, loop)
Get music and store in string list
Get audio file metadata
Music notification (artcover, muesic control buttons)

Search the music list

Make music offline if music is online (download)

Headset control

Android features like (mediaSession, audioFocus)

Make feature available for old and new sdk

Basic musicplayer features I will pay you for help with some special features I have in mind

And can you try iOS or no?
